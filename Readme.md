# How to conditionally change FormatString


<p>This example demonstrates how you can allow end-users to conditionally change a control's FormatString value.</p><p>For this, a Boolean parameter is created. Its value determines which formatting to implement. Since the actual task is to deliver this functionality to end-users, the only possible way to do this is to use scripts. So, see the <strong>myReport.Detail.Scripts.OnBeforePrint</strong> property in which the corresponding script is being stored.</p><p>If you don't need to spread this functionality to the End-User Designer, you're recommended to handle the Detail band's BeforePrint event in a similar way.</p>
